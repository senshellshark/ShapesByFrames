# Shapes By Frames
 A blender add-on that creates shape keys from animation frames named according to a text file.


## Usage
 Use a mesh object with an armature and pose it on several frames. For example, a face rig posing for visemes and facial expressions. Then make a text file listing all the names for the shape keys. The line numbers in the text file will correlate with the frames of the current animation of the armature. Select both the mesh and the text file with the Shapes by Frames addon and hit Create Shape Keys.


## Planned Features (Not yet implemented)
* Warn of shape keys already existing
* Option to override existing shape keys of the same name
* Offer operator in places other than the side panel
* Skip blank lines on name list
* Think of a better description for what this does (better yet, make a short video)
